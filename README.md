# Thesis_ReprogrammingFAIRGANs
Fairness-aware GANs (FairGANs) exploit the mechanisms of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to impose fairness on the generated data. As such, they are capable of liberating the data and its use from both disparate impact and disparate treatment. Given the high performance of this model, this paper has tried to develop a transfer learning framework that could widen its applicability and ease of use. Thus, ''Reprogramming FairGANs'' is intended as the possibility of using a pre-trained FairGAN and apply it to other datasets and classification tasks, while maintaining the three main targets of a FairGAN, i.e., data utility, classification utility, and data fairness. Through the use of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) we have been able to allow our architecture to change the dimensions of the data given in input. Without such dimensional flexibility we would not have been able to reprogram across different datasets. Our experiments are generally positive, although we also show that balancing all the three goals simultaneously can be tricky and sometimes lead to unacceptable trade-offs.
